I am the associated instructor (generally known as TA) for *CSCI B503 Algorithm Design and Analysis*, instructed by professor Funda Ergun. Course page can be found [here](http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/fergun/TEACHING/FA14/503.html).

This course intends to be a graduate level course but is relatively easy compared with the algorithm course I took when I was an undergrad.

Homework assignments and the solutions I compiled for this course will be posed in this page.
